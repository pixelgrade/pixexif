#A WordPress Plugin to Edit Image EXIF Metadata#

It bugged me for not finding a plugin that would allow the simple task of editing EXIF metadata. WordPress has no way for this as it reads the EXIF metadata on upload, saves it in the database and game over.

So here is a simple plugin that will add extra fields to the Edit Image page with the following EXIF fields: camera, aperture, focal length, shutter speed and ISO. I felt these are the main ones that count and didn't want to overcrowd the page with more fields.

Enjoy.
